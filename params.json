Zones <zone>\r\n\r\n<zone type=\"main\" \"left_margin\" \"library\" \"pagination\" \"top\">\r\n\r\nThe manuscript page is divided into zones. The \"main\" zone contains the main body of writing. The \"pagination\" zone contains page numbers supplied by the author. The \"library\" zone contains additional information, such as folio numbers, supplied by the holding library. The \"top\" zone contains chapter headings or titles. And the \"left-margin\" zone indicates that a margin has been created on the left side of the page using a vertical pencil line. For the Frankenstein manuscript, the left margin zone is used as a space for additions. The differing characteristics of manuscript sources will determine what kinds of zones will be used.\r\n\r\n## 2. Lines <line>\r\n\r\nEach line of writing in the manuscript is nested within the <line> element. \r\n\r\n<line>of the storm without wishing to</line>\r\n\r\n## 3. Paragraphs <milestone unit=\"tei:p\"/>\r\n\r\nTo indicate a paragraph break, use the <milestone> element. \r\n\r\n<line>This is the end of a paragraph.</line>\r\n<milestone unit=\"tei:p\"/><line><space extent=\"3\"/>This is the start of a new paragraph.</line>\r\n\r\nThe backslash \"/\" indicates that the element is empty, so it does not require a closing element.\r\n\r\n## 4. Simple Additions <add place=\"superlinear\" \"sublinear\" \"intralinear\">\r\n\r\n<line>the wild fancies of the<add place=\"intralinear\" hand=\"pbs\">se</add> authors with</line>\r\n\r\nHere, Percy has simply added \"se\" to the to make \"these.\" For additions that appear above the line use the \"superlinear\" attribute, for those below use \"sublinear\".\r\n\r\n<line>I <add place=\"superlinear\" hand=\"#pbs\">cheerfully</add> consented.</line>\r\n\r\n## 5. Simple Deletions <del rend=\"strikethrough\" \"smear\" \"overwritten\" \"vertical_line\">\r\n\r\n<line>aplied myself to <del rend=\"strikethough\">m</del> the more <del rend=\"strikethrough\">ra</del> rational</line>\r\n\r\nHere, the \"m\" and the \"ra\" have been struckthrough without any other modifications. The most common deletion type is a strikethrough. Less common forms of deletion include ink smears and overwrites. Because overwritten text includes both an addition and a deletion, it would be encoded within a <mod> element that links them together as a single authorial intervention. For example,\r\n\r\n<line>th<mod><del rend=\"overwritten\">is</del><add place=\"intralinear\">e</add></mod> text has been overwritten</line>\r\n\r\nThe \"is\" in \"this\" has been written over with an \"e\" to make \"the.\" \r\n\r\n## 6. Cross-linear Additions and Deletions <addSpan> <delSpan> <anchor xml:id/>\r\n\r\n<line><delSpan rend=\"vertical_line\" spanTo=\"#c56-0015.01\"/>phænonema. On Elizabeth   \r\n     and</line>\r\n<line>Clerval it produced a <del rend=\"strikethrough\">di</del> very different</line>\r\n<line>effect. They admired the beauty</line>\r\n<line>of the storm without wishing to</line>\r\n<line>analyze its causes. Henry said that</line>\r\n<line>the Fairies and giants were at</line>\r\n<line>war and Elizabeth attempted</line>\r\n<line>a picture of it.</line><anchor xml:id=\"c56-0015.01\"/>\r\n\r\n## 7. Simple Modifications <mod>\r\n\r\nThe <mod> element is used to group several revisions into one textual intervention: for example, substitutions, corrections, and overwrites. The <mod> element also allows us to encode the sequence of these changes. In the example below, \"difference\" was canceled and replaced by \"alteration\", which appears above the original line. \r\n\r\nIt is encoded as:\r\n\r\n<line>a great <mod><del rend=\"strikethrough\">difference</del><add place=\"superlinear\">alteration</add></mod> in my sensations; before</line>\r\n\r\nThe <mod> element is also used to group together a caret and the additional text it signifies.\r\n\r\n<line>. . . for <mod><add place=\"sublinear\"><metamark>&#x2038;</metamark></add> <add place=\"superlinear\">he</add></mod> was<del rend=\"strikethrough\">con</del> constantly</line>\r\n\r\nThe caret was inserted below the line after \"for\" and indicates that the \"he\" added above the line should be inserted.\r\n\r\n## 8. Cross-linear Modifications <mod><add next=\"\">\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at a complex modification that spans several lines. These are more difficult because of the nesting problems that arise when attempting to link together a modification that spans across the <line> element. Link cross-linear additions and deletions by inserting the \"next\" attribute within the element and linking it to an xml:id with the same value within the partner addition or deletion. \r\n\r\n<line><mod><del rend=\"strikethrough\" next=\"#c56-0013.01\">When it was most</del>\r\n     <add place=\"superlinear\" hand=\"#pbs\" next=\"#c56-0013.02>As I stood at the   \r\n     door</add></mod></line>\r\n<line><mod><del rend=\"strikethrough xml:id=\"c56-0013.01\">violent</del>,\r\n     <add place=\"superlinear\" hand=\"#pbs\" xml:id=\"c56-0013.02>on a  \r\n     sudden</add></mod></line>\r\n\r\nWe can now clearly see that \"When it was most {line break} violent\" was replaced with the superlinear addition of \"As I stood at the door {line break} on a sudden\"\r\n\r\n## 9. Linking Material from Different Zones <ptr>\r\n\r\nIn the Frankenstein rough draft, many of the pages are divided by a vertical pencil line that creates an empty left margin within which to make additions or add comments. To link additions from the left margin to the text in the main draft zone, use the <ptr> (pointer) element. Text in the left margin is encoded as an addition, so nest it within the <add> or <addSpan> element. The xml:id is given within the <add> or <addSpan> element so that the <ptr target=\"\"> element can identify within the main zone where the marginal addition is meant to be placed. Use <anchor/> to indicate the end of an <addSpan>. The <anchor/> element is empty and only indicates the end of a sequence of text. The xml:id in the <add> or <addSpan> element identifies the passage that is meant to be inserted into the main zone.\r\n\r\n<zone type=\"main\">\r\n<line> . . . <add><ptr target=\"#c56-0014.02\"/></add> . . . </line>\r\n<zone/>\r\n\r\n<zone type=\"left_margin\">\r\n        <addSpan xml:id=\"c56-0014.02\" spanTo=\"#c56-0014.03\" hand=\"#pbs\"/>\r\n        <line>its progress</line>\r\n        <line>with curiosity</line>\r\n        <line>&#x26; delight</line><anchor xml:id=\"c56-0014.03\"/>\r\n<zone/>\r\n        \r\nFor a marginal addition of only a single line, simply place an xml:id within the <add> element to link it to the <ptr> element within the main zone.\r\n\r\n<zone type=\"left_margin\">\r\n    <line><del rend=\"strikethrough\"><add xml:id=\"#c57-0002.02\"  \r\n            hand=\"#pbs\">various</add></del></line>\r\n  </zone>\r\n\r\nIn the above example, the addition was later deleted, so it is nested within the <del> element.\r\n\r\nThe following example is more complex:\r\n\r\n<zone type=\"left_margin\">\r\n<delSpan rend=\"vertical_line\" spanTo=\"#c57-0078.02\"/>\r\n<addSpan xml:id=\"#c57-0078.03\" spanTo=\"#c57-0078.02\" hand=\"#pbs\"/>\r\n    <line>I think</line>\r\n    <line>the journey</line>\r\n    <line>to England</line>\r\n    <line>ought to be</line>\r\n    <line><hi rend=\"underline\">Victor's</hi> propo</line>\r\n    <line>-sal.— that he</line>\r\n    <line>ought to go</line>\r\n    <line>for the purpose of</line>\r\n    <line>collecting</line>\r\n    <line>knowledge, for</line>\r\n    <line>the formation</line>\r\n    <line>of a female.</line>\r\n    <line>He ought to</line>\r\n    <line>lead his father to</line>\r\n    <line>this in</line>\r\n    <line>the conversa</line>\r\n    <line>tions—the</line>\r\n    <line>conversation</line>\r\n    <line><hi rend=\"underline\">commences</hi></line>\r\n    <line>right enough</line><anchor xml:id=\"c57-0078.02\"/>\r\n</zone>\r\n\r\nThis marginal addition, in the hand of Percy, was ultimately deleted by striking through the text with a vertical line. There are also several passages that have been underlined. Use the <hi> (highlight) element with \"underline\" a the attribute to indicate the change in appearance.\r\n\r\nThe next example is even more complex and includes the unholy alliance of cross-linear additions and deletions, super- and sublinear additions, and text from the left margin that is meant to be inserted into the main body. Furthermore, there are hand shifts between MWS and PBS and instances where MWS overwrites in ink what PBS had written in pencil. To avoid madness, simply indicate the hand as it is given in the transcription file. The reviewer will sort out the details later. \r\n\r\nIf the text showed only a multiple-line deletion from \"my own hard nerves\" to \"young ma\" then we could simply encode the deletion using <delSpan>. But since there are additions meant to replace that deleted text, we need to use <mod> with the \"next\" attribute; otherwise, those additions would be subsumed as part of the <delSpan>. So each addition and deletion needs to be encoded separately for each line and then linked together with the \"next\" attribute. We also need to use the <ptr> element to indicate where the additions in the left margin should be placed in the main zone. \r\n\r\n<zone type=\"main\">  \r\n<line>love that I felt <mod>\r\n\t<del rend=\"strikethrough\" next=\"#c57-0013.02\">my own hard nerves</del>\r\n\t<add hand=\"#pbs\" place=\"superlinear\" next=\"#c57-0013.03\">sensations of a peculiar \t\t&#x0026; overpowering</add></mod></line>\r\n<line><mod>\r\n\t<del rend=\"strikethrough\" xml:id=\"c57-0013.02\" next=\"#c57-0013.04\">move and I was \tobliged to withdraw from</del>\r\n\t<add><ptr target=\"#c57-0013.05\"/></add>\r\n\t<add place=\"superlinear\" hand=\"#pbs next=\"#c57-0013.06>mixture of pain &#x0026; \tpleasure; such <del rend=\"strikethrough\">as</del> as I had never experienced</add> \t</mod></line>\r\n<line><mod>\r\n\t<del rend=\"strikethrough\" xml:id=\"c57-0013.04\">my the hole.  Presently the young \tma</del>\r\n\t<add hand=\"#pbs\" place=\"superlinear\" xml:id=\"c57-0013.06\"> either from <del \trend=\"strikethrough\">the</del> hunger or cold, <del rend=\"strikethrough\">orfrom</del> \tor warmth or food and I</add> <add><ptr target=\"#c57-\t0013.07\"/></add></mod></line>\r\n<milestone type=\"tei:p\"/><line><space extent=\"2\"/>Soon after this the young man \treturned</line>\r\n</zone>\r\n\r\n<zone type=\"left_margin\">\r\n       <line><add xml:id=\"c57-0013.05\">nature they <add place=\"superlinear\">were \ta</add></line>\r\n</zone>\r\n\r\n<zone type=\"left_margin\"><addSpan xml:id=\"c57-0013.07\" spanTo=\"#c57-0013.08\"/>\r\n      <line>withdrew</line>\r\n      <line>from my station</line>\r\n      <line><handShift new=\"#pbs\"/>unable to</line>\r\n      <line>bear these</line>\r\n      <line><del rend=\"strikethrough\">emotio</del>ns</line>\r\n      <line><handShift new=\"#mws\"/>emotions</line><anchor xml:id=\"c57-0013.07\"/>\r\n</zone>\r\n\r\n## 10. Shifts in Hands <add hand=\"#pbs\" \"#comp\"> <handShift new=\"#pbs\">\r\n\r\nTo indicate an addition in a hand other than that of the primary author, use the \"hand\" attribute within the <add> element.\r\n\r\n<line>string <mod><del rend=\"strikethrough\">and</del><add place=\"superlinear\" hand=\"#pbs>which</add></mod></line>\r\n\r\nTo indicate a shift in hands, use the <handShift> element. For example, in the fair-copy draft of Frankenstein, Percy takes over for Mary for an extended number of pages. Since this is not an addition, we mark the beginning of Percy's hand with <handShift new=\"#pbs/>. The backslash indicates that the element is empty and that the shift in hand continues until another shift in hand takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 11. Uncertain Readings <unclear unit=\"char\" extent=\"\">\r\n\r\nText that is illegible is enclosed within the <unclear> element. If the text is partially recognizable, indicate it as follows:\r\n\r\n<line>During her confinement <unclear>mady</unclear> many</line>\r\n\r\nIf the text is obscured by ink blots, foxing, or is completely illegible. Use an empty <unclear> tag and indicate the approximate length of the uncertain reading. \"char\" stands for \"characters\".\r\n\r\n<line>During her confinement <unclear unit=\"char\" extent=\"4\"/> many<line>\r\n\r\n## 12. Encoding Spaces <space extent=\"\">\r\n\r\nTo encode significant spaces between passages or words, use the <space> element and indicate the length of the space.\r\n\r\n<line>acquired <space unit=\"char\" extent=\"20\"/> and</line>\r\n\r\nDo not encode spaces unless there is a noticeable gap that extends well beyond the normal variation of spaces within a handwritten manuscript.\r\n\r\n## 13. Damage to the Manuscript <damage>\r\n\r\nIf text is illegible or missing from manuscript because of damage, such as being torn or cut away, use the <damage> element. The reviewer will add more details to the encoding. \r\n\r\n\r\n## 14. Special Character Entities (hexadecimal values)\r\n\r\nCaret (^): &#x2038;\r\nAmpersand (&): &#x26;\r\nEm-dash (—):&#x2014;\r\nEn-dash (–):&#x2013;\r\næ dipthong: &#xE6;\r\n\r\n\r\n## 15. Paratextual Notations and Additions <note> <metamark>\r\n\r\nFor paratextual notations such as carets, brackets, and \"X\"s that indicate insertion points for added material, enclose them within the <metamark> element.\r\n\r\nFor notes or instructions added by either the author or compositor, use the <note> element. For example, in the fair-copy draft for Frankenstein, the compositor writes his initials and indicates where he either ends or begins typesetting: \r\n\r\n<line><note><add hand=\"#comp\">F. W.<metamark>/</metamark>My courage . . .</line>\r\n\r\n## 16. Reviewing and Closing Encoded Transcription Files and Issues (Reviewers Only)\r\n\r\n1.
